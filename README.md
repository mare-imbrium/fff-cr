# fff-cr

Crystal port of dylanaraps/fff : freakin fast file manager written in bash.
I am just learning Crystal, so this is just for learning.

Features:
- move between directories using arrow keys or h/l.
- open files with right arrow.
- select files and move or delete or yank

I have not ported everything.

Not ported:
- bulk rename
- image display -- can't install whatever it is, so can't run it
- pick key mappings from ENV
- some very bash specific stuff.
- open a shell
-

## Installation

HOW TO INSTALL CRYSTAL executable ?

Copy files over or clone repo.
Run crystal build src/fff.cr
Copy fff to ~/bin or any other directory in PATH.

## Usage

Just run it, ok ?
